Visualization of My Google Location History

Exploring GitHub for a while and reading about data visualization inspired me to map my Google location history data. I had my Android Phone since 2016, so the GPS coordinates will be starting from 2016 until this year (2019). I took the GPS coordinates from Google as a JSON file. For the code, I used Python and its pandas, matplotlib, and basemap libraries.
